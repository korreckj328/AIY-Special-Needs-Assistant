AIY - Special Needs Assistant.  

This is based off my previous idea of an Alexapi based Special Needs Assistant.  However I've heard that the AVS API v1 may cease functioning on April 30 2018 so I've been working on creating my system solely through the Google API.  The install.sh script will install the files where they need to go and start the program on boot.

Currently there is no error handling and functions are limited with some commands returning "This function is not yet implemented."  

This software requires a Raspberry Pi set up with the Google AIY Voice Kit and AIY system image.  It uses Google's Cloudspeech api,  you will have to set up your own google account and download credentials as instructed in the instruction book that comes with the Google AIY Voice Kit.  The cloudspeech API does have a charge if you go over the free usage amount every month but at the time of me writting this,  google gives each new account a $300.00 credit so you will be able to see if this software helps you and how much it will cost you each month to run this software.

Please post any issues that are found with the software and keep checking back as the software will have many updates in the days that come as I iron out bugs.
